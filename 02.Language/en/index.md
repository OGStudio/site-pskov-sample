Title: About me
Slug: index

Hi, my name is Valentin Serov. Here's my self-portrait:

![Valentin Serov self-portrait][serov-portrait]

I'm a famous Russian painter, one of the premier portrait artists of the early 20th century. I also have a [Wikipedia article][serov] about myself. It's good to know people still care about me, even though I died in 1911, even before [1917 Russian revolution][revolution] struck.

One day I woke up and decided my paintings can change the world. So I started to paint. And it felt great.

[Girl with Peaches][girl-with-peaches] is my most recognized work. Just look at this beauty:

The other day I woke up and decided I should learn a bit of HTML and CSS to have a personal web site. I got my self-portrait and the "Girl with Peaches" images from Wikipedia. They are said to be in public domain, so I hope I didn't violate anyone's copyright.

I have used [PSKOV][pskov] static site generator to create this web site. Send all complaints to **PSKOV**'s authors, not me, I'm already dead.

Have a look at my [CV][cv] now.
